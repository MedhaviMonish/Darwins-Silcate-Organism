# Darwinâ€™s Silcate Organism

A survival-driven artificial organism built from modular AI components â€” memory, curiosity, reward, and decision-making â€” all working together to form emergent behavior.

> This is not just an agent.  
> This is a silicate lifeform, born from experience, shaped by survival. 

## Status
ðŸ§ª In active development  

## Goals
- Simulate the emergence of intelligent behavior under constraint
- Replace rigid programming with learning-driven memory and survival instincts
- Explore how intelligence might arise from minimal structure and simple rules
